## What You'll Find Here

- A backend service with endpoints for seed creation and validation.
- An Android app built with Jetpack Compose, supporting QR code generation and scanning.
- Modular, maintainable codebases for both server and client.
- Documentation for setup, testing, and further improvements in each component's README.
